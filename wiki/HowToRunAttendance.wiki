#summary Running attendance in game.

= Introduction =

How to run attendance during a raid in World of Warcraft using LegionTracker.

= Details =

Currently (1-3-2012) it is possible for multiple officers to run attendance at the same time.  For this reason, there should be vocal communication on who is running attendance.
  * Determine who is going to run attendance as the raid is about to begin.
  * Once the raid time has started, the designated officer should first right click on the `<Click for timer>` and ensure the times are set correctly.
    #Typically if the raid is set for 4 hours, I set it to 4 hours and 20 minutes.  This way if we run late, people will still get credit, it also avoids a timing issue which can cause the last tick to not go off.
  * When the timer settings have been set correctly, click *OK*
  * The first thing it will ask you is if you want to reset Attendance and Loot.  Click Yes (only at the start of the raid night).
  * When the raid is ending, before stopping the timer, complete the following steps:
    # Open the main LegionTracker window and check the *Raiders* and *Offline* checkboxes.
    # Sort the members by Attendance first.  Review anyone who isn't at 100% or 0%.  They may have missed a tick randomly, clean up the data.
    # Sort the members by Sitting next.  Review anyone who isn't at 100% or 0%.  They may have been marked sitting while we were re-arranging groups.  Clean up the data.  On farm nights it is difficult to see what is an anomoly and what isn't since groups change so often.
  * Left click the timer once the data cleanup is complete.  It will ask if you want to stop the timer.  Click *Yes*.
